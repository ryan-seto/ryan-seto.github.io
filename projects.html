                    coded in Pygame as my first ever software project. The basis of the games is to use the left and right arrow keys
                    to move your ship and shoot space invaders. By, pressing the space bar, you can shoot down enemies. Don't let them get
                    to the bottom of the screen or you lose!

                    this website as I learn more web design in the future. I'm looking forward to constantly improving this site
